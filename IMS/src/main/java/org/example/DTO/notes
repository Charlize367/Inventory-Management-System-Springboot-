Let’s say you purchase 10 boxes of soap.

Insert into purchases:

purchase_id = 101, supplier_id = 12

Insert into purchase_items:

purchase_item_id = 2001, purchase_id = 101, product_id = 5, quantity = 10

Insert into stock_movements:

movement_id = 5001, product_id = 5, movement_type = 'purchase', reference_id = 101, quantity = +10

Stock updated:

If product 5 had 20 in stock, now it’s 30.

stock +- purchaseQuantity
